# AI MERN Image Generation

This project is a full stack web application developed using the *MERN* (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack that allows users to create AI generated images based on their input text using *DALL-E* API. The application also offers modern and minimal design with dynamic layout, hover effects, and sharing options with the community.

***Features added :***

* Generate images based on user's prompts.
* Search functionality.
* Download generated images to user's device.
* Modern and minimal design for easy navigation and clean interface.
* Dynamic layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
* Hover effects that generate user's prompt along with username and download button.
* Share functionality to share the AI generated images with the community on the community section.

## üìñ Lessons Learned

By working on this project, I have learned several valuable lessons which helped me to build a broad range of skills that are useful in a variety of web development projects, including:

- *Full Stack Web Development*

The project involves working on both the front-end and back-end of the application, so that allowed me to gain a better understanding of full-stack web development.

- *MERN Stack*

Developing the application using the MERN stack provided me an opportunity to learn about the different technologies involved, including MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

- *Image Processing*

Working on this image generation project somehow it provided me a chance to learn about image processing techniques, including manipulating images based on user input.

- *Sharing System*

By developing a feature that allows users to share their AI generated images with the community has provided me an insight into the importance of social features in web applications.

- *Design and User Experience*

Building a modern and minimalistic design taught me about the importance of design and user experience in web applications and how they impact user engagement.
